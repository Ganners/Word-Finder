Word Finder (PHP)
=================

An incredibly simple and quick anagram solver and word finder. This 
project initially started to prove that the longest word that could be typed 
with the top line of a keyboard was 'typewriter'. I've also found other uses 
for it; such as solving anagrams, solving Countdown problems and can even be 
used to solve the popular Photo Quiz phone app.

Example usage is in index.php
